# My-Portfolio

## Description

Hello and welcome to my professional portfolio! This website has been created to showcase all my projects and assignments that I have completed during the Penn LPS Full stack development Bootcamp that I recently graduated from! On the website you will be able to learn more about me, the technologies I learned/used and some of the applications I built. Right now, all the applications are from the bootcamp course work but hopefully soon I will have some applications on there that I have built outside of the class. The applications I am most proud of are the 3 projects we as a team were able to complete and build. For every project I worked on not only was I a lead developer but also a project manager. Please feel free to check out my professional portfolio by clicking on the “Usage” links down below!
